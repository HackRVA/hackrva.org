          <h2 class="title is-3">Become a Member</h2>
          <p>
            We have open house events every Thursday night. If you can’t make it
            for those, send us an email at
            <a href="mailto:info@hackrva.org">info@hackrva.org</a> and we can
            arrange a tour. New members must be on-boarded (set up RFID access,
            and review membership agreement, safety rules, supply locations,
            etc) before they can use the space. When you decide to join, come to
            an open house, or if that is not possible, contact us at
            <a href="mailto:info@hackrva.org">info@hackrva.org</a> and we can
            arrange on-boarding for you. We have no paid staff and manage this
            in our spare time so please be patient with us.
          </p>

          <h3 class="title is-4">Not sure about becoming a member?</h3>
          <p>
            Come to any open house! It is also our weekly night to get together.
            There will be members there you can talk to.
