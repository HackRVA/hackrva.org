# Hackrva.org

This is hackrva's website (not live yet).
The intention is for the site to be low maintenance.
So, it is a flat website with vanilla javascript and html with minimal dependencies.  The content should be mostly evergreen.
No build step required.

### Local Development

A golang web server is included for convenience, but it's not required.
```
go run ./tools/web-server/main.go
```
