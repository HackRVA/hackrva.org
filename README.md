# Hackrva.org

This is an experiment of building this site with a static site generator - using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/),.
[demo](https://hackrva.github.io/hackrva.org/)

### Installation

```
$ npm ci
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```
$ USE_SSH=true npm run deploy
```
