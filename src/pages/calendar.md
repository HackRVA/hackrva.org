# Calendar

The HackRVA Calender. See when classes, hackathons, open houses, special interest meetings, and general events are scheduled. Click into an event for detailed information.
Special events with additional details can also be seen at <a title="HackRVA meetup" href="http://www.meetup.com/HackRVA-Meetup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HackRVA meetup</a>
, though all events are also listed here on the calender. (Some classes do require sign up through meetup though, to help limit class size and maintain a wait list).


If you're a member and would like to host an event or teach a class, contact us. Everyone's encouraged to teach, learn, and do.
