## Become a Member

We have open house events every Thursday night. If you can’t make it for those, send us an email at info@hackrva.org and we can arrange a tour. New members must be on-boarded (set up RFID access, and review membership agreement, safety rules, supply locations, etc) before they can use the space. When you decide to join, come to an open house, or if that is not possible, contact us at info@hackrva.org and we can arrange on-boarding for you. We have no paid staff and manage this in our spare time so please be patient with us. 

### Not sure about becoming a member?

Come to any open house! It is also our weekly night to get together. There will be members there you can talk to.
