Hello hackers, makers, and fellow doers-of-things!

HackRVA decided to get in the "remodel mood" this winter.

We got a little crazy and built such things as a sliding barn door for the tech lab, beautiful new work tables, custom computer desks, and an outdoor metal working area .

Thanks to all the members who helped build it! And a special thanks to [Matt for doing a lot of the heavy lifting](https://www.instagram.com/isthatmattporr/). These projects exist because of his extra effort and dedicatedÂ labors.

Check out the cool pics below, AND more pics after the break below!
