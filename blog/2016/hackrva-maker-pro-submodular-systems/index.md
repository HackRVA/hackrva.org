Rob of [submodluar systems](http://submodularsystems.com/)Â  sez:

"Over 2 years ago we started an odyssey that has now culminated in our first production release of submodular systems's [**shadow 6u eurorack travel case**](http://submodularsystems.com/shop/shadow). Much of the original development and conceptualization would not have been possible without the great space and friends at HackRVA. Much thanks to all of you for your support and encouragement. We are off to [NAMM in LA](https://www.namm.org/) and will send feedback."

We're often asked if HackRVA can be a resource for entrepreneurs. Well, simple answer, yup.

I would also like to mention that Rob has contributed to building our fablab, taught classes, and provided much maker wisdom at HackRVA. So, as with many of our best experiences in the makersphere, it's a symbiotic win/win relationship.

Way to go Rob and good luck at NAMM!
