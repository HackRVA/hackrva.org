Jim Groom from [Reclaim Hosting](https://reclaimhosting.com/) and [other](http://jimgroom.net/) [parts](https://twitter.com/jimgroom?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) [of the web](http://chronicle.com/article/Jim-Groom/130917/) recently presented a workshop at HackRVA on creating your own digital identity. We talked about what it means to own your own domain, then demonstrated how to create a quick and dirty wordrpess site, what is and how to use c-panel, and some cool tools that can be implemented when you have your own web presence.

We're thankful to Jim and Reclaim Hosting for putting on this workshop and getting many of us jumpstarted on creating our own online kingdoms!
