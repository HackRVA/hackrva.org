For many years now we've been meeting every Saturday to hack to our heart's content. It is known as the weekly "Saturday Hackathon". This usually starts at 1pm and goes until 7pm, but often starts earlier, and even more often goes much later.

The above is a quick panorama taken from last Saturday. Much a' making and hacking going on.
