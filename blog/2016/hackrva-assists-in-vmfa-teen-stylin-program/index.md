Shellie and other HackRVA'ers have been working hard to bring some STEAM to the fashion world with the VMFA Teen Stylin' fashionistas!

This is the laser cutting a nautilus gear brooch we've creating for participants in the VMFA Teen Stylin' program. The gear set is an amalgamation of fashion and engineering meant to give a hands on familiarity in the the use of gears. The student designers will be able to decorate or mod them in unique ways.

More to come on this great pairing.
