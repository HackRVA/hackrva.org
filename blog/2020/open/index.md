We are open and operating normally, with Open House every Thursday night from 7 to 9 PM. Membership has come back close to our pre-COVID average. We announce special events on MeetUp, even when they are members only. We have thousands of followers there, and we want them to see we are active. We also use MeetUp when we do classes to limit the number of people, and manage wait lists.
