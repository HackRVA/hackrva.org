[RVA Makers](http://phoenixhandcraft.com/rva-makers/) visited HackRVA for a lovely night of discussion about making, professional making, and the maker culture of Richmond. We demonstrated soldering, showed off our tools, and talked about our organization with this wonderful group of makers, many who make for a living.

Onward Richmond Makers! Onward!
