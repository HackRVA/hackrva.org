A group of coders and aspiring coders mashed buttons while staring into screens in attempts to learn some code. We were trying [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/), which is a learning tool in the vein of [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com), but seems more extensive. These code learning websites are unique in that everything is done in the browser. This gets rid of the sometimes difficult task of learning the user interface in a development environment, much less the installation. So instead, you go straight to coding itself. Each lesson builds on the last and it starts from the very beginning of things. freeCodeCamp is also unique as it proposed to take people all the way to a somewhat professional level of understanding by going "full stack". Like many of the meatspace code boot-camps that have started to pop-up, like [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com/), freeCodeCamp focuses on webby programming with html5, javascript, jquery, and json in the learning pipe. It's possibly more get a job than get a computer science degree, or their just addressing changing times where the web rules. Anyway, it's a worthwhile experience to try it out.
