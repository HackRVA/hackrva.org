We had [a party to take apart old tech](http://www.meetup.com/HackRVA-Meetup/events/219755580/) in the name learning.

Taking things apart is a great way to examine the objects in our daily lives. Â This fun activity also grows your maker insight as you learn about components, assembly, and materials.
