HackRVA partnered with [Small Hall Makerspace from William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/as/physics/resources/makerspace/index.php) to teach soldering and make bristlebots with kids at [Makerfest 2015](http://rvamakerfest.com/2015-makerfest-2/).

We had about 10 tables in the outdoor area behind the Science Musuem of Virginia. Eric was there building support for a [new Richmond area STEM initiative](http://www.meetup.com/RVA-Stem/). Andy taught people about drones. Dustin and Paul fielded general questions about the HackRVA Makerspace. And 30 or so additional volunteers taught kids - we were jam packed all day long. Some volunteers were lucky to make it out intact due to mobbing. Someone said, "A mob creates more mob." Obviously kids were hungry to learn maker skillz as they besieged our tables.

All in all, 300-400 kids were introduced to the ways of soldering, and 300 bristlebots were constructed.

It was an excellent event.
