We did it again - gathered around for tidings of makery bliss during our home-brew holiday blend of Halloween and Thanksgiving. We talked about how the year has gone, played a litany of humorous games, consumed mounds of food, wore our hats-o'-snark, and BUILT A CATAPULT! We may or may not have played corn hole with the catapult and launched a bird.
