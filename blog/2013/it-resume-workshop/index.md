The best recruiters out there say you should update your resume regularly, whether you’re looking for a new position or not. It’s a great way to keep track of your accomplishments.

On Tuesday, February 12, at 7pm we will be having Jennifer Henderson, Recruiting Director for the Richmond Consultant Shop Ironworks, to give a talk and even some hands-on assistance with Richmond IT Professionals who aren’t exactly sure what their resume should look like these days.

Refreshments will be provided. Bring a current copy of your resume, business cards if you have them, and something to take notes with.

See you then!
