## **HackRVA is expanding!**

Did I mention that HackRVA is expanding?

Whoa, a new room just appeared overnight.

 

This room will be a "free-use" multipurpose room, but our goal is to keep it booked with classes and workshops.

Keep a close eye on our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/HackRVA-Meetup/).  This is where we post the events that we host at HackRVA.

Stop in on an Open House to see the progress.  Btw, we do open houses every Thursday evening from 7 - 10.
