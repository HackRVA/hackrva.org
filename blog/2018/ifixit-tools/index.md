Our friends at [iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com/) have outfitted hackRVA with a full set of tiny tools.

 

Need to fix a tiny device?  HackRVA more than likely has the tools you need to do that.

We've had these kits for a couple of weeks now and they've come in handy for fixing 3D printers, computers, smart phones, and tiny DIY electronic devices!
