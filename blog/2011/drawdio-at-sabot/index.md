 Several month’s ago,

hack.rva held a weekly, month long, class on the drawdio. This class was taught to three middle school students at Sabot School in Stony Point. During the class, basics of soldering and electrical circuits were taught while also slowly assembling the drawdio circuit. At the end of the class, the students made a movie teaching what they learned and showing off a little bit. These wonderful kids are proof that nobody should be scared of electronics–a healthy dose of science is good for ya!
