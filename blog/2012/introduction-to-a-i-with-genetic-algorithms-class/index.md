An Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class will be offered at hack.rva by Erica Absetz.  This class will be the first in a series of A.I. Algorithms.  We will use Genetic Algorithms as a starting point because the concepts are easy for beginners to understand. Concepts covered will include Initialization, Selection, Reproduction (which includes crossovers and mutation), Termination and the uses of Genetic Algorithms. Participants with programming skills can stay after the class for a lab session; during which the instructor will assist in programming a basic Genetic Algorithm.
