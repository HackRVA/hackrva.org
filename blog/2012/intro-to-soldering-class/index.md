from Babs -

The Introduction to Soldering Class was a success! There were a lot of new faces in hack.rva for the class and we had a total of 20 participants.  Everyone got to take home their soldering iron and their finished project, which was a flashing siren.  Thank you to Luke for teaching the class and thank you to everyone who signed up.
