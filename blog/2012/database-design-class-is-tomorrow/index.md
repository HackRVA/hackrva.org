Database Design class is tomorrow.

I’ll provide copies of MySQL Workbench and a primary MySQL server deployed within HackRVAs network that we can run some simple queries off of.

I’ll also lead everyone through the process of setting up a server in two Linux distributions, Fedora and Ubuntu.

Then I’ll cover table creation, the basics of storage engines, how best to debug a server instance (with and without access to the linux instance it’s running on) and i’ll show everyone how to connect some common applications to it, such as syslog-ng and apache ActiveMQ.

Finally, if we have time, I’ll explain some programming principles and tools centered around the best ways to work with databases, such as Object Relational Mappers in Python.
