from Babs -

We will be holding an Introduction to E-Textiles class taught by Erica Absetz. The class will cover different types of e-textiles and a beginner level project. Participants will receive an Aniomagic Sparkle Kit, which will be used to learn how to sew circuits into fabric.



Sparkle is an avant-garde way to make interactive textiles, paper, ceramics, and environments. Change the way it works directly from a web browser by holding it in front of a computer screen or smartphone. Participants will need no programming experience to program the sparkle board. We strongly recommend bringing your own Mac/Linux/Windows laptop will allow you more time to change the programming. Scraps of fabric will be available to use during the class; however, it is recommended that participants bring an item that they would like to use for their project (ex. shirt, hat, bag).
