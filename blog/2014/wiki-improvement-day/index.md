We document, therefore we wiki. Or in some cases Git/Instructables/ThingAVerse/ProjectBlog/BuildLog/\*things\*... but in this case we were all about getting the HackRVA Wiki back up to speed.

We re-located the wiki, added many new needed pages, cleaned out the old stuff, documented equipment, and made a place for member pages.

And perhaps the number one improvement, we made it easier for members to get a log-in. Just create an account from the page and answer a human-question + captcha.

We hope to see the wiki getting more use so members can learn about the equipment, projects, and _other_ (like the killer floor plan above) at the space.

[Check it out](http://www.hackrva.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page)! Or even better, get an account and add your improvements!
