An awesome [Arduino Workshop](http://www.meetup.com/HackRVA-Meetup/events/193352972/) happened for July's HackRVA Workshop Series!

They night started calm enough, learning some basic Arduino skillz.. but then later, as the learning escalated, they ended up battling it out in a demolition event using the Arduino autonomous RC robot cars they made themselves in the workshop.
