We recently held a workshop on learning to solder. We had 12 makerspace enthusiasts attend.  Some were getting a refresher and others were new to the art of connecting wire with hot metal. We had a great time!

We assembled the [kit pictured above](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=026-000R-00007).  Everyone enjoyed themselves and definitely got a solid intro experience to this key maker skill, but the end-result of the kits were a little anti-climatic on features, so we'll be looking for a more expansive kit next go around.

If you're interested in future classes in the maker workshop series at HackRVA, just follow us on [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/HackRVA-Meetup/). We're going to be doing CAD, wearables, and basic electronics in the near future.
