Neal's BARC Jeep won a [second prize in the recent Instructables Microcontroller Contest](http://www.instructables.com/contest/micro2013/). Neal is a HackRVA member and built much of his project at the space.

He had some helping hands such as Fred troubleshooting software problems and others helping with fab. Dustin shot the video and I got to help write up the project for Instructables. Projects have a way of coming together at the space with multiple brains and hands.

The modded power wheels jeep is driven remotely from an xbox controller. Check out the [complete build on Instructable here](http://www.instructables.com/id/BARC-Jeep-An-XBOX-Controlled-Power-Wheels/).

Way to go on your win Neal!
